          So, you might be wondering why this person would want to sell haunted houses. You
          might think that there are a couple of screws loose. Well, that might be
          true, but when this project started, it was after discovering that
          there is a market and a desire for haunted houses. Along with our
          estate agents, we work closely with our clients to ensure we
          deliver a home suited to their needs. <br />
          <br />
          With our dedication, innovation and commitment to providing the best
          customer service, we have been able to stay on top of the Haunted
          Property Industry. <br /><br />
          Starting off in Eastern Europe, we have now been able to expand our business
          to Western Europe. With continued growth, we do not plan on ever
          moving away from our culture and objectives.
